Ritual Scheme

A toy implementation of R5RS for scripting, written in C to be easily
embeddable. Clearly not yet finished, not yet even properly begun.

Goals:
 * reasonably efficient for common tasks -- use C libraries (GMP,
   especially); Scheme purity is not a goal
 * easily sandboxable wrt attacks more serious than DoS when
   executing hostile code (so swapping config files / scripts
   is safe)
 * clean C interface for easy embedding (when ready for use, also
   create a C++ layer around it)
 * supports Linux and Windows (and OSX), little system-dependence
 * at least externally multithreaded (possible to run separate
   code in separate threads without interference)
